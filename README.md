# stbx
This is a collection of my work in Matlab. This is a work in progress. Many funtions are stubs and many more do not handle all the cases they were planned to. Things will get updated when I have time to to get my hands on it.

Code documentaion is fair in many of the newer files but may be lacking in the older ones.

One of the major general issues I want to resolve is to find a way to generate documentaion from comments in Matlab files and put it on the main path here with links to the specific functions from within the doc.
